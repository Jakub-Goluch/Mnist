# Mnist
Neural Network project on mnist database

I've created model on mnist databased inspired on model frow tensorflow tutorial.
While modifying model by adding layers, kernel regularizer and activiation functions I've managed to increase accuracy on test data from initial 97,5% do 98,32% on the same number of epochs.
